Common encryption techniques include:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys, one for encryption (public key) and one for decryption (private key). Examples include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
- **Hash Functions**: Transform data into a fixed-size hash value. Examples include SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) and MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5).
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption to leverage the strengths of both. A common approach is to use asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a symmetric key, which is then used for data encryption.
